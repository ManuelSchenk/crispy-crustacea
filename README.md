# ToDo

* [x] make the statistics static when numbers change it flips its position
* [x] create a pause key binding
* [x] move elapsed time into header
* [x] disable position changes with arrow keys (with a key binding)
* [ ] add Readme
* [x] use only one timer for header and statistics
* [x] force backspace after type fault (red cursor is shown)




* [ ] store the results in a sqlite and visualize in textual
* [ ] provide beginners lections with reduced key set (create the example text with chatGPT)
