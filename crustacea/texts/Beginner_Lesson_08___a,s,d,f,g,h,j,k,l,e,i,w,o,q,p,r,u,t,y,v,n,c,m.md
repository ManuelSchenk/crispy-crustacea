The soft kite flew over wet ground today
Kind trees grow from moist soil and dew
Child girls sing soft tunes near green hills
Silent frogs jump quickly in wet meadows
Dogs and cats love sweet moist food
Chickens crow early when light fills farm
Giant whales swim deep in cold water
Silent owls hunt at night in quiet woods
Silly monkeys swing from tall trees daily
Fresh lemon tart fits well for hearty lunch
Lively children create grand tales and myths
Sweet honey drips over fresh fruit salad
Colorful tulip garden shows pure lively charm
Modest clerks work in quiet office halls
Smart young students learn strict core math
Night sky shows rich deep cosmic art
Daring jockeys ride swift horses in race
Fierce lions hunt many small prey daily
Garden paths wind slow toward quiet neat yards
Eager students type quickly on smart keys
